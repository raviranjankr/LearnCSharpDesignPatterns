Wikipedia says =>

A proxy, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to something else. A proxy is a wrapper or agent object that is being called by the client to access the real serving object behind the scenes. Use of the proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object, or can provide additional logic. In the proxy extra functionality can be provided, for example caching when operations on the real object are resource intensive, or checking preconditions before operations on the real object are invoked.

Real World Example => 

What could be best example for Proxy Pattern than defining login system of computer. There can be two account one is as normal user and other one is as an admin. User account is not password protected and admin account is password protected. To Login system you need to enter valid password to open and for normal user account you can simply login without any credential. 

Notes => 

* You can control the service object without clients knowing about it.
* The access to an object should be controlled.
