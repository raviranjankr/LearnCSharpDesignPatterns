Wikipedia says =>

The mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way it can alter the program's running behavior.

Real World Example => 

We will try to implement a chat application where users can do group chat. Every user will be identified by it’s name and they can send and receive messages. The message sent by any user should be received by all the other users in the group.

Notes => 

* Mediator pattern is useful when the communication logic between objects is complex, we can have a central point of communication that takes care of communication logic.
* We should not use mediator pattern just to achieve lose-coupling because if the number of mediators will grow, then it will become hard to maintain them.
