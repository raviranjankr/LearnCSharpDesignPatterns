# Design Patterns 
In software engineering, a software design patterns mean a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
Just don't get be confused with Design Patterns with algorithms. Both describe solutions for some known common problem but they both retain different meaning and the way of implementations. 
While an an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal where as  a design pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. 

In general, a pattern has four essential elements:
<ul>
<li>Pattern name : Having a name for patterns lets us talk about them.</li>
<li>Problem :  It describes when to apply the pattern.  The problem will include a list of conditions that must be met before it makes sense to apply the pattern.</li>
<li>Solution : It describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.</li>
<li>Consequences : Sometime listing consequences explicitly helps us to understand and evaluate problems.</li>
</ul>

# Types of Design Patterns

There are three kinds of Design Patterns in software engineering:
<ul>
<li>Creational</li>
<li>Structural</li>
<li>Behavioral</li>
</ul>

# Creational Design Pattern 
Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. 

Following are the well known five design pattern that belongs to Creational Design Pattern.
<ul>
<li>Factory Method</li>
<li>Abstract Factory</li>
<li>Builder</li>
<li>Prototype</li>
<li>Singleton</li>
</ul>

# Structural Design Pattern 
Structural design patterns are design patterns that describe the ways of organizing classes or objects so that they are easy to use. 

Following are the well known seven design pattern that belongs to Structural Design Pattern.
<ul>
<li>Adapter</li>
<li>Bridge</li>
<li>Composite</li>
<li>Decorator</li>
<li>Facade</li>
<li>Flyweight</li>
<li>Proxy</li>
</ul>

# Behavioral Design Pattern 
Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. 

Following are the well known ten design pattern that belongs to Behavioral Design Pattern.
<ul>
<li>Chain of Responsibility</li>
<li>Command</li>
<li>Iterator</li>
<li>Mediator</li>
<li>Memento</li>
<li>Observer</li>
<li>State</li>
<li>Strategy</li>
<li>Template Method</li>
<li>Visitor</li>
</ul>

# Importance Of Design Pattern
Being a novice programmer, designing object-oriented based application is bit hard. You must have learning of finding pertinent objects, factor them into classes at the right granularity, define class interfaces and 
inheritance hierarchies, and establish key relationships among them. Your design should be specific to the problem at hand but also general enough to address future problems and requirements.
