Wikipedia says =>

The memento pattern is a software design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback).

Real World Example => 

Let us assume, We have a bank account that we transfer money to someone from it. If the account has not required balance then the transfer must be rolledback without changing the account state.

Notes => 

* The internal state of an object should be saved externally so that the object can be restored to this state later.
* Using Memento design pattern it can be easy to play object as saving its internal state to a (memento) object and restoring to a previous state from a (memento) object.
