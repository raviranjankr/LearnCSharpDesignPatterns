<h3>Wikipedia says</h3> 

The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes


<h3>Real World Example</h3>

Different types of authors write different kinds of story — which are likely to be published by dramatically different publishers. This is a great use of the abstract factory method. To simplify our comparison, we’ll modernize the publisher types a bit and use a blog for publishing poems and a scientific journal for publishing research papers. If we have a poem ready to be published, we need an appropriate type of publisher for it, such as a Blog. Similarly, a scientific paper, might require a scientific journal for publication.
